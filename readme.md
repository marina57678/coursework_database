## Ð¡reate a database
You can download the database from the link </br>
[db.mwb](https://github.com/marina57678/coursework_database/blob/main/coursework.mwb)

## Html markup + css + native js
It was decided to make the site in a modern style
- dynamic data handling
- the ability to delete and add directly on the site (soon only for admin)
- adaptive site 
- 3d cards (js animation)
